# bitmap-font [![Rust 1.57+](https://img.shields.io/badge/rustc-1.57+-orange.svg)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/12/02/Rust-1.57.0.html) [![License Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-On%20Github-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/msrd0/bitmap-font)

This crate provides bitmap fonts for the [`embedded-graphics`][__link0] crate. Those donâ€™t only look better than the [built-in fonts][__link1] by using the good-looking [Tamzen font][__link2] over a font that renders `.` like a `+`, but also allow scaling fonts by pixel-doubling them, giving you two font sizes for the flash size requirements of the smaller one.

See the [`tamzen`][__link3] module for a list of all included fonts.


## Usage


```rust
use bitmap_font::{tamzen::FONT_8x15, BitmapFont, TextStyle};
use embedded_graphics::{pixelcolor::BinaryColor, prelude::*, text::Text};

// Draw text 'Hello World!' with the top left corner being the origin
let text = Text::new(
	"Hello World!",
	Point::zero(),
	TextStyle::new(&FONT_8x15, BinaryColor::On)
);
text.draw(&mut display)?;
```
